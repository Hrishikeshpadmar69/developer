## Introduction
In Python, sets, lists, and dictionaries are versatile data structures that are crucial for organizing and manipulating data efficiently. 
Understanding their properties and methods can greatly improve your ability to write clean and effective code.

* This repository covers the following topics:

- 1. Sets: Unordered collections of unique elements.
- 2. Lists: Ordered collections of elements, mutable.
- 3. Dictionaries: Collections of key-value pairs, mutable and unordered.<br>

# Installation

You can download Python from the official website.
Additionally, if you want to execute the Jupyter notebooks, you'll need to install Jupyter Notebook. 
* You can install it via pip: pip install jupyter


# Usage
You can explore the examples provided in the Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks in this repository. Each file focuses on specific aspects of sets, lists, and dictionaries, demonstrating their creation and various methods available for manipulation.

Here's a brief overview of the contents:

- sets_example.py: Illustrates set creation, methods for set manipulation, and common set operations.
- lists_example.py: Covers list creation, list methods, and techniques for list manipulation.
- dictionaries_example.py: Demonstrates dictionary creation, dictionary methods, and how to work with key-value pairs.
